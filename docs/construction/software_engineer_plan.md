# Software Engineer Implementation Plan

## Overview

I am implementing the AI Configurator enhancement based on the software architect's comprehensive design. The architecture provides a clear roadmap with 9 units of work across 3 phases, focusing on user-specific configurations, library synchronization, and MCP server management.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Implementation (Weeks 1-4)

#### Step 1: Create Domain Model âœ…

- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Design Domain Model based on architect's component model
  - Map architectural components to domain entities
  - Define relationships and interactions
  - Document business logic and behaviors
  - Create domain model documentation

#### Step 2: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Set up enhanced CLI framework (Click + Rich)
  - Replace argparse with Click for better command structure
  - Integrate Rich for enhanced terminal output
  - Create basic menu system and navigation
- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Implement core data models with Pydantic validation
  - Create AgentConfig, MCPServerConfig, LibraryMetadata models
  - Add JSON schema validation
  - Implement model serialization/deserialization
- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Create configuration management system
  - Implement Config Manager component
  - Add backup and restore functionality
  - Create configuration directory structure
- [ ] **Task 2.4**: Set up project structure and dependencies
  - Update pyproject.toml with new dependencies
  - Create proper package structure
  - Set up development environment

#### Step 3: Personal Library Management (Week 2-3)

- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Implement Library Manager component
  - Create base vs personal library separation
  - Implement library file discovery and indexing
  - Add library metadata management
- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Add configuration versioning
  - Implement version tracking for configurations
  - Create version history management
  - Add rollback capabilities

#### Step 4: Basic Agent Management (Week 3-4)

- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Implement Agent Manager component
  - Create agent CRUD operations
  - Add agent validation and health checks
  - Implement Q CLI export functionality
- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Create tool-specific exporters
  - Focus on Q CLI agent format
  - Ensure compatibility with existing Q CLI schema
  - Add validation for exported configurations

#### Step 5: Testing and Documentation (Week 4)

- [ ] **Task 5.1**: Create comprehensive tests
  - Unit tests for all components
  - Integration tests for workflows
  - CLI command testing
- [ ] **Task 5.2**: Document implementation
  - Update README with new functionality
  - Create user guide for new features
  - Document API and component interfaces

## Questions for Clarification

### [Question] Implementation Priority

Should I implement all Phase 1 units sequentially, or would you prefer to see a working prototype of the core infrastructure first before proceeding?

[Answer] You can do it sequentially

### [Question] Backward Compatibility

During implementation, should I maintain the existing CLI commands alongside the new ones, or implement a clean replacement?

[Answer] clean replacement

### [Question] Testing Strategy

Do you want me to implement tests as I go (TDD approach) or complete the implementation first and then add comprehensive tests?

[Answer] TDD approach is good

### [Question] Migration Strategy

Should I implement the migration from the current system as part of Phase 1, or focus on the new system first and handle migration separately?

[Answer] Take what you need from the existing system, you can create a new branch too and start a fresh implementation

### [Question] External Dependencies

Are you comfortable with adding the new dependencies (Click, Rich, Pydantic, Watchdog) or should I minimize external dependencies?

[Answer] Yes feel free to add dependencies into the .venv environment

## Domain Model Design Approach

Based on the architect's component model, I will create a domain model that includes:

### Core Entities

- **Library**: Manages knowledge files and synchronization
- **Agent**: Represents AI agent configurations
- **MCPServer**: Manages MCP server configurations
- **Configuration**: Handles user preferences and settings

### Value Objects

- **LibraryMetadata**: Version, sync status, conflicts
- **AgentConfig**: Agent-specific settings and resources
- **MCPServerConfig**: Server connection and configuration details

### Services

- **LibraryService**: Business logic for library operations
- **AgentService**: Business logic for agent management
- **MCPService**: Business logic for MCP server management
- **ConfigService**: Business logic for configuration management

### Repositories

- **LibraryRepository**: Data access for library files
- **AgentRepository**: Data access for agent configurations
- **MCPRepository**: Data access for MCP server data
- **ConfigRepository**: Data access for user configurations

## Implementation Standards

### Code Quality

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints throughout
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage
- Document all public APIs

### Architecture Principles

- Follow the architect's layered architecture
- Implement clear separation of concerns
- Use dependency injection where appropriate
- Keep components loosely coupled

### Error Handling

- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Provide clear error messages to users
- Create recovery mechanisms where possible
- Log errors appropriately

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files

- `docs/construction/software_engineer_domain_model.md`
- `ai_configurator/models/` - Pydantic models
- `ai_configurator/services/` - Business logic services
- `ai_configurator/repositories/` - Data access layer
- `ai_configurator/cli_enhanced.py` - New CLI implementation
- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for new components
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests

### Modified Files

- `pyproject.toml` - Add new dependencies
- `ai_configurator/__init__.py` - Update package structure
- `README.md` - Document new features

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

- [ ] User can create and manage personal library separate from base library
- [ ] Basic agent creation works with new CLI interface
- [ ] Configuration backup and restore functionality works
- [ ] All components have comprehensive tests
- [ ] Migration from current system preserves existing data
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (operations complete in <5 seconds)

## Next Steps

1. **Create Domain Model** - Document the domain entities and their relationships
2. **Get Approval** - Review plan with stakeholder before implementation
3. **Begin Implementation** - Start with core infrastructure (Task 2.1)
4. **Iterative Development** - Implement, test, and validate each component
5. **Integration Testing** - Ensure components work together correctly
