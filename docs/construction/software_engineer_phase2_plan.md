## Questions for Clarification

### [Question] Implementation Order

Should I implement all sprints sequentially, or would you prefer to see working prototypes of each sprint before moving to the next?

[Answer] You can implement all sprints sequentially

### [Question] Testing Strategy

Do you want comprehensive testing after each sprint, or should I focus on implementation speed and add tests at the end?

[Answer] Implementation speed is okay and testing later

### [Question] User Feedback Integration

How should I handle user feedback during implementation? Should I pause for feedback after each sprint?

[Answer] yes, if you have questions, otherwise continue

### [Question] Backward Compatibility

Should I maintain full backward compatibility with Phase 1, or is it acceptable to have breaking changes with migration tools?

[Answer] you can have breaking changes, the software is not in use. No need to do migrations

### [Question] External Dependencies

Are you comfortable with adding new dependencies for advanced features (e.g., GitPython for better diff handling, requests for registry sync)?

[Answer] Yes
