## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Phase 3 must not break Phase 2 functionality
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: New features are additive and optional
3. **Tool Agnostic**: Core system remains independent of specific AI tools
4. **Security First**: Security considerations in every design decision
5. **Performance Conscious**: Maintain responsiveness as system grows

### Quality Standards

- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 80%+ coverage for new features
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation for all new capabilities
- **Performance**: Operations complete within acceptable time limits
- **Security**: Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- **Reliability**: Graceful handling of failures and edge cases

### Technology Decisions

#### Multi-Tool Support
- **Adapter Pattern**: Clean separation between core and tool-specific logic
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for future AI tools
- **Configuration Schema**: JSON Schema for validation and documentation

#### Cloud Integration
- **Backend Technology**: Consider FastAPI for REST API
- **Database**: SQLite for local, PostgreSQL for cloud
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- **Storage**: S3-compatible for file storage

#### Performance & Scalability
- **Caching**: Redis for distributed caching
- **Background Jobs**: Celery for async operations
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- **Logging**: Structured logging with ELK stack

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items

   - Risk: Different AI tools have incompatible features
   - Mitigation: Adapter pattern with graceful degradation

2. **Cloud Sync Conflicts**
   - Risk: Complex merge conflicts in team environments
   - Mitigation: Operational transform algorithms, user education

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Risk: System becomes slow with large datasets
   - Mitigation: Incremental loading, caching, performance testing

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Risk: Cloud features introduce attack vectors
   - Mitigation: Security-first design, regular audits, penetration testing

### Medium Risk Items

1. **Plugin System Complexity**
   - Risk: Plugin API becomes too complex or unstable
   - Mitigation: Simple, well-documented API with versioning

2. **Tool Version Compatibility**
   - Risk: AI tools change formats breaking compatibility
   - Mitigation: Version detection, migration tools, adapter updates

[Answer] 

### [Question] Team Features Scope

How complex should team collaboration be? Simple shared libraries or full organizational management with roles and permissions?

[Answer] 

### [Question] Plugin System Timing

Should the plugin system be in Phase 3 or deferred to Phase 4? It's powerful but adds significant complexity.

[Answer] 

### [Question] Performance Targets
