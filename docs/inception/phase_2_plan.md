# Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Planning Date: October 1, 2025

## Phase 2 Objectives

Build on the excellent Phase 1 foundation to deliver advanced features that make the AI Configurator a comprehensive tool for managing AI agent configurations.

## Priority-Based Implementation Strategy

#### Technical Tasks:

- [ ] **Task 2.8**: Build MCP server registry system

  - Local registry of available MCP servers
  - Remote registry synchronization
  - Server metadata and descriptions

- [ ] **Task 2.9**: Implement server discovery and installation

  - Browse available MCP servers
  - One-click server installation
  - Dependency management

- [ ] **Task 2.10**: Enhance MCP management UI
  - `mcp browse` - Browse available servers
  - `mcp install <server>` - Install MCP server
  - `mcp search <term>` - Search server registry

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Users can discover MCP servers without manual research
- [ ] Server installation is automated and reliable
- [ ] Registry stays updated with latest servers
- [ ] Server metadata helps users choose appropriate tools

### ‚ú® **Sprint 4: Enhanced User Experience** (Week 7-8)

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Polish and improve user workflows

#### User Stories to Implement:

- **US-010**: Interactive Agent Management (enhance existing)
- **US-012**: Improved CLI Experience (enhance existing)

#### Technical Tasks:

- [ ] **Task 2.11**: Add interactive wizards

  - Agent creation wizard with templates
  - MCP server configuration wizard
  - Library setup wizard for new users

- [ ] **Task 2.12**: Implement advanced CLI features

  - Tab completion for commands and options
  - Command history and favorites
  - Batch operations for multiple agents

- [ ] **Task 2.13**: Add configuration templates
  - Pre-built agent templates for common use cases
  - Template sharing and import/export
  - Template customization workflow

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] New users can set up their first agent in under 2 minutes
- [ ] Common workflows are streamlined with wizards
- [ ] Power users have advanced batch operation capabilities
- [ ] Templates accelerate agent creation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Approach

1. **Incremental Development**: Each sprint builds on previous work
2. **User Feedback Integration**: Test with real users after each sprint
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with Phase 1 implementation
4. **Quality First**: Maintain the high code quality standards from Phase 1

### Technical Standards

- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 80%+ test coverage for new features
- **Documentation**: Update documentation for each new feature
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Performance**: Ensure CLI remains responsive with large libraries

### Risk Mitigation

- **Data Safety**: Always backup before destructive operations
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert changes if issues occur
- **Graceful Degradation**: Features should fail gracefully if dependencies unavailable
- **User Control**: User always has final say in automated operations

## Success Metrics for Phase 2

### Sprint 1 Success Metrics:

- [ ] 100% of users can sync library without data loss
- [ ] Conflict resolution takes < 5 minutes for typical conflicts
- [ ] Zero reported cases of lost user customizations

### Sprint 2 Success Metrics:

- [ ] Local file patterns work in 95% of common project structures
- [ ] File watching detects changes within 5 seconds
- [ ] Users report improved workflow integration

### Sprint 3 Success Metrics:

- [ ] MCP server discovery reduces setup time by 80%
- [ ] Server installation success rate > 95%
- [ ] Users find relevant servers within 2 minutes

### Sprint 4 Success Metrics:

- [ ] New user onboarding time < 2 minutes
- [ ] 90% of users prefer new wizards over manual configuration
- [ ] Power user productivity increases by 50%

## Phase 2 Completion Criteria

### Must Have (Required for Phase 2 completion):

- ‚úÖ Library synchronization with conflict resolution
- ‚úÖ Local file management with pattern support
- ‚úÖ Enhanced MCP server registry and discovery

### Should Have (Highly desirable):

- ‚úÖ Interactive wizards for common workflows
- ‚úÖ Configuration templates and sharing
- ‚úÖ Advanced CLI features (tab completion, etc.)

### Could Have (Nice to have if time permits):

- ‚ö™ Multi-tool support beyond Q CLI
- ‚ö™ Cloud synchronization capabilities
- ‚ö™ Team collaboration features

## Next Steps

1. **Get Approval**: Review this plan with stakeholders
2. **Sprint 1 Kickoff**: Begin library synchronization implementation
3. **User Testing**: Engage beta users for feedback after each sprint
4. **Iteration**: Adjust plan based on user feedback and technical discoveries

## Questions for Stakeholder Review

### [Question] Sprint Priority

Do you agree with the sprint prioritization, or would you prefer to tackle MCP server registry before local file management?

[Answer] As we are implementing both today (with AI) it's okay to start with local file management

### [Question] User Testing

Should we engage beta users after each sprint, or wait until Phase 2 completion?

[Answer] I'm the beta user and I'll test in between

### [Question] Scope Adjustment

Are there any additional features you'd like to see in Phase 2, or any current features you'd like to descope?

[Answer] no, let's work on getting the basic system up and running
