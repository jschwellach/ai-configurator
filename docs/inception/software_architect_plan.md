# Software Architect Plan - AI Configurator Enhancement

## Current Stage: Step 1 - Analysis and Planning

I am currently in **Step 1** of the software architecture process, focusing on analyzing the current system and creating a comprehensive plan for enhancement.

## Plan Overview

This plan addresses the user's request to enhance the ai-configurator system with improved usability, user-specific configurations, and better MCP server management.

## Tasks Checklist

### Phase 1: Analysis and Requirements ✅

- [x] **Task 1.1**: Analyze current system architecture and identify enhancement opportunities
  - Review existing CLI structure and agent management
  - Identify limitations in current mcp.json and agent-config.json approach
  - Document current user workflow pain points
- [x] **Task 1.2**: Create user stories from user perspective for the enhanced system
  - Define user personas and their needs
  - Create comprehensive user stories covering all enhancement areas
  - Prioritize user stories by value and complexity

### Phase 2: Architecture Design ✅

- [x] **Task 2.1**: Design component model for the enhanced architecture
  - Define system components and their interactions
  - Design user-specific configuration management
  - Plan MCP server registry and management system
  - Design CLI UI for interactive management

- [x] **Task 2.2**: Define technology stack and implementation approach
  - Evaluate current Python-based CLI architecture
  - Define database/storage approach for user configurations
  - Plan CLI UI framework and interaction patterns
  - Consider backward compatibility requirements

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning ✅

- [x] **Task 3.1**: Create implementation roadmap with phases
  - Break down work into manageable implementation units
  - Define dependencies between components
  - Plan migration strategy from current system
  - Estimate effort and timeline

## Key Enhancement Areas Identified

Based on the user's requirements, the following areas need enhancement:

1. **User-Specific Configuration Management**

   - Store user-specific roles and configurations
   - Personal library evolution over time
   - Configuration versioning and backup

2. **Library Synchronization System**

   - Synchronize examples without overwriting user customizations
   - Merge/replace options for library updates
   - Conflict resolution mechanisms

3. **Local File Management**

   - Support for additional local files per agent (e.g., `./rules/**/*.md`)
   - Dynamic file discovery and inclusion
   - File watching and auto-updates

4. **MCP Server Registry and Management**
   - Centralized MCP server registry
   - Per-agent MCP server configuration
   - CLI UI for managing MCP server attachments
   - Server discovery and installation

## Questions for Clarification

### [Question] User Configuration Storage

Should user-specific configurations be stored locally only, or do you envision cloud synchronization capabilities for sharing configurations across devices?

[Answer] I think for now we can do a local store only and leave it to the user.

### [Question] Library Update Strategy

When synchronizing library updates, what should be the default behavior when conflicts occur between user customizations and upstream changes?

[Answer] Highlight the issue to the user and let the user decide if they want to overwrite or keep the local changes. We can add a diff tool later.

### [Question] MCP Server Registry

Should the MCP server registry be:

- A local catalog of available servers
- A remote registry with automatic updates
- Both local and remote with synchronization

[Answer] Both, but let's keep it simple. The library within the ai-configurator is just an example, so we can provide standard roles like software architect, software engineer, product owner and our recommended role definitions and tools (MCP) servers. The user however has the ultimate control within the local library so the user can have it's own mcp registry/list and this can be added to the agents.

### [Question] CLI UI Framework

Do you have preferences for the CLI UI framework? Options include:

- Rich/Textual for advanced TUI
- Simple menu-based interaction
- Mixed approach with both simple and advanced modes

[Answer] I'm thinking in a simple UI and offload edit etc to other tools like vim or vs-code

### [Question] Backward Compatibility

How important is maintaining backward compatibility with the current system? Should we plan for:

- Full backward compatibility
- Migration tools with breaking changes
- Clean slate approach

[Answer] We can start with a clean slate approach, but we should keep the existing roles and mcp configurations within the tool and when we configure the AI (e.g. Q CLI) we need to make sure to make a backup before removing the provious agents / configs.

## Next Steps

After receiving answers to the clarification questions, I will proceed to:

1. **Complete the analysis** (Task 1.1)
2. **Create detailed user stories** (Task 1.2)
3. **Request approval** before moving to Step 2 (Component Model Design)

## Files to be Created

- `docs/inception/software_architect_units_of_work.md` - Units of work breakdown
- `docs/inception/software_architect_component_model.md` - Component model design
- `docs/inception/technology_stack.md` - Technology stack decisions

---

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All software architecture tasks completed successfully
**Next Action**: Ready for development team to begin Phase 1 implementation

## Architecture Summary

### Completed Deliverables
1. **User Stories** (`user_stories.md`) - 14 user stories across 6 epics with clear priorities
2. **Component Model** (`software_architect_component_model.md`) - Layered architecture with 5 core components
3. **Technology Stack** (`technology_stack.md`) - Python 3.9+ with Click+Rich, comprehensive tech decisions
4. **Implementation Plan** (`software_architect_units_of_work.md`) - 9 units of work across 3 phases (12 weeks)

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Personal vs Base Library** separation for user customization
- **Conflict-aware synchronization** with user control
- **Simple CLI UI** with external editor integration
- **Local + Remote MCP registry** with user control
- **Clean slate approach** with comprehensive backup system

### Implementation Ready
The architecture is complete and ready for development. The plan provides:
- Clear component boundaries and interactions
- Detailed technology choices with rationale
- Comprehensive implementation roadmap
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and acceptance criteria

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 implementation starting with Unit 1 (Core Infrastructure).
