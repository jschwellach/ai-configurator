## Git-Based Library Architecture

### Initial Setup Flow
```bash
# First install
ai-config init
# -> Clones library from GitHub
# -> Sets up local configuration
# -> Guides user through sync options

# Library updates
ai-config library update
# -> git pull from upstream
# -> Handles conflicts with personal changes
# -> Shows what changed
```

### Team Sync Options
```
Option 1: Shared Network Folder
├── /shared/ai-configurator/
│   ├── library/          # Git repo (read-only for users)
│   └── personal/         # User-specific (synced via filesystem)

Option 2: Syncthing
├── ~/ai-configurator/
│   ├── library/          # Git repo (updated by admin)
│   └── personal/         # Synced via Syncthing

Option 3: Nextcloud/Dropbox
├── ~/Nextcloud/ai-configurator/
│   ├── library/          # Git repo
│   └── personal/         # Cloud synced
```

### Benefits of This Approach
- **No Custom Backend**: Leverage Git's proven sync capabilities
- **User Choice**: Teams pick their preferred sync solution
- **Simple Maintenance**: Standard Git operations for updates
- **Offline Support**: Full functionality without internet
- **Version Control**: Git history for library changes
- **Flexibility**: Works with any Git hosting (GitHub, GitLab, self-hosted)

## Production Features

### Error Handling & Recovery
```python
# Example: Robust operation with rollback
@with_rollback
@with_error_handling
def sync_library():
    try:
        backup = create_backup()
        perform_sync()
        validate_result()
    except Exception as e:
        rollback_to_backup(backup)
        log_error_with_context(e)
        show_user_friendly_message(e)
        suggest_solutions(e)
```

### Performance Optimization
- **File Discovery**: Cache results, incremental scanning
- **Library Loading**: Lazy loading, background indexing
- **Memory Usage**: Streaming for large files, garbage collection
- **Startup Time**: Parallel initialization, cached metadata

### Security Hardening
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized
- **File Operations**: Safe path handling, permission checks
- **Configuration**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- **Git Operations**: Secure credential handling

### Monitoring & Health Checks
```bash
# Health check command
ai-config health
# -> Library integrity: ✅
# -> Git repository: ✅  
# -> Configuration: ✅
# -> Performance: ⚠️ Slow file discovery
# -> Disk space: ✅
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Principles
1. **Reliability First**: Every operation must be safe and recoverable
2. **Performance Conscious**: Maintain responsiveness as libraries grow
3. **User Experience**: Clear feedback and helpful error messages
4. **Maintainability**: Clean code, comprehensive tests, good documentation
5. **Security Minded**: Secure by default, validate everything

### Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ for production features
- **Performance**: All operations < 5 seconds for typical libraries
- **Reliability**: 99.9% operation success rate
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: Complete operational and user documentation

### Technology Decisions
- **Git Integration**: Use GitPython for robust Git operations
- **Logging**: Use Python's logging with structured output
- **Configuration**: YAML/JSON with schema validation
- **Caching**: Simple file-based caching for performance
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks, external monitoring optional
