# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Configurator system currently provides a sophisticated framework for profiles, contexts, and hooks, but lacks pre-defined examples that users can easily build upon. This feature will add a comprehensive set of example templates across all three configuration types, making the system more accessible to new users and providing proven patterns for common use cases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user of the AI Configurator, I want access to pre-defined profile examples, so that I can quickly understand how to structure profiles and adapt them for my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user explores the profiles directory THEN the system SHALL provide at least 5 example profiles covering different use cases
2. WHEN a user examines an example profile THEN the system SHALL include clear documentation explaining the profile's purpose and configuration options
3. WHEN a user wants to create a new profile THEN the system SHALL provide examples that demonstrate best practices for profile structure and naming conventions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the AI Configurator, I want pre-defined context examples, so that I can understand how to create effective context files and see proven patterns for different domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user browses the contexts directory THEN the system SHALL provide at least 8 example context files covering various professional domains
2. WHEN a user reviews an example context THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive content that demonstrates effective context structuring
3. WHEN a user needs domain-specific guidance THEN the system SHALL provide contexts for common areas like development, project management, security, and communication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user configuring automation workflows, I want pre-defined hook examples, so that I can understand hook capabilities and implement common automation patterns without starting from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user explores the hooks directory THEN the system SHALL provide at least 6 example hooks demonstrating different trigger types and automation patterns
2. WHEN a user examines an example hook THEN the system SHALL include clear documentation explaining the hook's purpose, triggers, and expected outcomes
3. WHEN a user wants to implement automation THEN the system SHALL provide hooks that cover common scenarios like file watching, context enhancement, and workflow automation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user learning the AI Configurator system, I want comprehensive documentation for all example templates, so that I can understand how to customize and extend the provided examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any example template THEN the system SHALL provide inline documentation explaining configuration options
2. WHEN a user wants to modify an example THEN the system SHALL include comments or documentation explaining customization points
3. WHEN a user needs to understand relationships between components THEN the system SHALL provide documentation showing how profiles, contexts, and hooks work together

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the example templates to follow consistent naming and organizational patterns, so that the system remains maintainable and users can easily navigate the examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN example templates are created THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions across all template types
2. WHEN users browse examples THEN the system SHALL organize templates in a logical hierarchy that groups related functionality
3. WHEN the system is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing example template structures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with specific workflow needs, I want examples that demonstrate integration between profiles, contexts, and hooks, so that I can see how to create cohesive automation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user explores examples THEN the system SHALL provide at least 2 complete workflow examples showing profile-context-hook integration
2. WHEN a user wants to understand component relationships THEN the system SHALL include examples that reference and build upon each other
3. WHEN a user implements a workflow THEN the system SHALL provide examples that demonstrate real-world use cases and best practices
