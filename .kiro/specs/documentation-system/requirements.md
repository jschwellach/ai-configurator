# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Configurator project currently has inconsistent and incomplete documentation. The README references several documentation files in a `docs/` directory that don't exist, while some documentation exists in the root directory (INSTALL.md, PACKAGE_SETUP.md). Additionally, referenced files like CONTRIBUTING.md and LICENSE are missing entirely. This feature will create a comprehensive, well-organized documentation system that provides clear guidance for users, developers, and contributors.
