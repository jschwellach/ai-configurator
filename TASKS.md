## Implementation Order

1. **Start with Task 1.1** (State Management) - Foundation for everything
2. **Then Task 1.2** (Workflow Definitions) - Core workflow loading
3. **Then Task 1.3** (Hook System) - Integration with AI
4. **Then Task 2.1** (Document Workflow) - First working example
5. **Then Task 3.1** (Profile Integration) - Make it usable
6. **Then Task 2.2** (SDLC Workflow) - Second example
7. **Finally Tasks 3.2, 4.1, 4.2** - Polish and documentation

## Success Criteria

After implementation, the system should:
- [ ] Guide users through complex multi-phase processes
- [ ] Maintain state across AI conversation sessions
- [ ] Provide contextual guidance based on current phase
- [ ] Generate artifacts and templates automatically
- [ ] Work seamlessly with existing profile system
- [ ] Be extensible for new workflow types

## Risk Mitigation

- [ ] Create backup branch before starting
- [ ] Test each component independently
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing profiles
- [ ] Keep workflow YAML schema simple and extensible
- [ ] Document breaking changes clearly

## Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1**: 12-15 hours (Core Infrastructure)
- **Phase 2**: 8-10 hours (Example Workflows)
- **Phase 3**: 4-6 hours (Integration)
- **Phase 4**: 5-7 hours (Testing & Documentation)
- **Total**: 29-38 hours

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this implementation plan
2. Create feature branch for workflow engine
3. Start with Task 1.1 (Workflow State Management)
4. Test each component incrementally
5. Update documentation as we build
