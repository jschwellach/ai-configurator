# AI Configurator Refactoring Plan

## Current Problems Identified

### 1. **Dual Library Structure** 
- **Problem**: Two separate library directories (`/library` and `/src/ai_configurator/library`)
- **Impact**: Confusion during development, sync issues, complex build process
- **Root Cause**: Package data management complexity

### 2. **Over-Complex Configuration Schema**
- **Problem**: Catalog.json has unnecessary metadata (downloads, ratings, domains, personas, etc.)
- **Impact**: Complex to maintain, most fields unused by AI
- **Root Cause**: Over-engineering for features that aren't needed

### 3. **Excessive Core Modules** (38 files in `/core`)
- **Problem**: Too many specialized classes and managers
- **Impact**: Hard to understand, maintain, and debug
- **Root Cause**: Over-abstraction and premature optimization

### 4. **Complex Profile Structure**
- **Problem**: Profile YAML files have too many fields and targets
- **Impact**: Confusing for users to create new profiles
- **Root Cause**: Trying to support too many use cases

## Refactoring Goals

1. **Simplicity**: Make it easy to add/manage profiles
2. **Single Source of Truth**: One library location
3. **Minimal Configuration**: Only essential fields
4. **Clear Structure**: Intuitive file organization
5. **Easy Development**: Simple to understand and extend

## Refactoring Tasks

  - âœ… Merged all commands into single `cli.py` file
  - âœ… Removed complex command groups and subcommands
  - âœ… Kept rich formatting for better user experience
  - âœ… Maintained JSON output options for automation

### Phase 4: Simplify Project Structure âœ… COMPLETED

#### Task 4.1: Flatten Directory Structure
- [x] **Reorganize project files** âœ… COMPLETED
  - âœ… Moved `/src/ai_configurator/` to `/ai_configurator/`

## Implementation Order

1. **Start with Phase 1** (Library Structure) - This fixes the immediate dual-directory issue
2. **Then Phase 2** (Core Architecture) - This reduces complexity
3. **Then Phase 3** (CLI Interface) - This simplifies user experience
4. **Then Phase 4** (Project Structure) - This cleans up the project
5. **Finally Phase 5** (Documentation) - This updates user-facing docs

## Success Criteria

After refactoring, the project should:
- [ ] Have single library directory
- [ ] Have <10 core Python files (currently 38)
- [ ] Have simple catalog.json with <5 fields per profile
- [ ] Have simple profile.yaml with <5 fields
- [ ] Allow adding new profile by just creating directory + YAML file
- [ ] Have <5 CLI commands
- [ ] Be understandable by new contributor in <30 minutes

## Risk Mitigation

- [ ] Create backup branch before starting
- [ ] Test each phase independently
- [ ] Keep existing functionality working during transition
- [ ] Update tests incrementally
- [ ] Document breaking changes

## Estimated Effort

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 2**: 4-5 hours  
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 hours
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 hours
- **Phase 5**: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: 10-15 hours

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create backup branch
3. Start with Task 1.1 (Consolidate Library Directories)
4. Test each change incrementally
5. Update tests as we go
