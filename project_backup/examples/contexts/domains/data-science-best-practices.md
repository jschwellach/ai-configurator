# Data Science Best Practices

## Overview

This context provides comprehensive guidelines for data science and machine learning projects, covering the entire ML lifecycle from data collection to model deployment and monitoring. These practices ensure reproducible, ethical, and high-quality data science work.

## Data Management

### Data Collection and Acquisition

- **Document data sources**: Maintain clear records of where data comes from, including APIs, databases, files, and third-party sources
- **Version control data**: Use data versioning tools (DVC, MLflow, etc.) to track dataset changes
- **Data lineage tracking**: Document data transformations and processing steps
- **Privacy compliance**: Ensure data collection follows GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations
- **Data quality assessment**: Validate data quality at ingestion time

### Data Storage and Organization

```
project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/           # Original, immutable data
│   ├── interim/       # Intermediate processed data
│   ├── processed/     # Final datasets for modeling
│   └── external/      # Third-party data sources
├── models/            # Trained models and model artifacts
├── notebooks/         # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
├── src/              # Source code for data processing and modeling
├── reports/          # Generated analysis and reports
└── references/       # Documentation and references
```

- **Separate raw and processed data**: Never modify raw data files
- **Use consistent naming conventions**: Follow team standards for file and directory naming
- **Document data schemas**: Maintain data dictionaries and schema documentation
- **Implement data backup strategies**: Ensure critical data is backed up and recoverable

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Data Understanding

- **Start with basic statistics**: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles
- **Check data types and formats**: Ensure appropriate data types for analysis
- **Identify missing values**: Document patterns and reasons for missing data
- **Detect outliers**: Use statistical methods and visualization to identify anomalies
- **Analyze distributions**: Understand the shape and characteristics of your data

### Visualization Best Practices

- **Use appropriate chart types**: Bar charts for categories, histograms for distributions, scatter plots for relationships
- **Include clear labels and titles**: Make visualizations self-explanatory
- **Choose accessible color schemes**: Consider colorblind-friendly palettes
- **Avoid misleading visualizations**: Ensure scales and axes don't distort the message
- **Document insights**: Add markdown cells explaining what visualizations reveal

### Code Organization in Notebooks

```python
# Standard imports at the top
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Configuration
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8')
np.random.seed(42)

# Helper functions
def load_and_validate_data(filepath):
    """Load data with basic validation."""
    pass

# Main analysis sections with clear headers
```

## Feature Engineering

### Feature Creation Guidelines

- **Domain knowledge integration**: Use subject matter expertise to create meaningful features
- **Feature scaling and normalization**: Apply appropriate scaling techniques (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler)
- **Categorical encoding**: Use appropriate methods (one-hot, label, target encoding) based on cardinality
- **Temporal features**: Extract meaningful time-based features (day of week, seasonality, trends)
- **Feature interactions**: Create interaction terms when domain knowledge suggests relationships

### Feature Selection

- **Remove highly correlated features**: Use correlation matrices and VIF to identify multicollinearity
- **Statistical significance testing**: Use chi-square, ANOVA, or mutual information for feature selection
- **Recursive feature elimination**: Use model-based methods to identify important features
- **Domain-driven selection**: Prioritize features that make business sense
- **Document feature engineering decisions**: Maintain clear records of why features were created or removed

## Model Development

### Model Selection Strategy

- **Start simple**: Begin with baseline models (linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees)
- **Cross-validation**: Use appropriate CV strategies (k-fold, stratified, time series split)
- **Multiple algorithms**: Test various algorithms appropriate for your problem type
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Use grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization
- **Ensemble methods**: Consider combining models for improved performance

### Training Best Practices

```python
# Example model training structure
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Train model with cross-validation
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)

# Fit and evaluate
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Comprehensive evaluation
print(f"CV Score: {cv_scores.mean():.3f} (+/- {cv_scores.std() * 2:.3f})")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Model Evaluation

- **Appropriate metrics**: Choose metrics that align with business objectives
- **Multiple evaluation approaches**: Use various metrics to get a complete picture
- **Statistical significance**: Test if model improvements are statistically significant
