- Customer-facing issues with media attention
- Security incidents with data exposure
- Multiple related incidents indicating systemic issues

### Escalation Chain

1. **On-call Engineer** â†’ **Team Lead** (30 min for Sev 1-2)
2. **Team Lead** â†’ **Engineering Manager** (1 hour for Sev 1, 4 hours for Sev 2)
3. **Engineering Manager** â†’ **Director** (2 hours for Sev 1, 8 hours for Sev 2)
