# Research Methodology Guidelines

## Research Process Framework

### 1. Topic Analysis & Planning
- Break down complex topics into specific research questions
- Identify key concepts, terms, and related areas to investigate
- Create a structured research plan with clear objectives
- Determine the scope and depth required for the analysis

### 2. Information Gathering Strategy
- Use multiple sources to ensure comprehensive coverage
- Prioritize authoritative and recent sources
- Cross-reference information across different sources
- Look for primary sources when possible
- Gather both supporting and contrasting viewpoints

### 3. Source Evaluation Criteria
- **Authority**: Check author credentials and institutional affiliations
- **Accuracy**: Verify facts against multiple sources
- **Currency**: Prioritize recent information, note publication dates
- **Relevance**: Ensure sources directly address the research questions
- **Objectivity**: Identify potential bias and consider multiple perspectives

### 4. Information Organization
- Categorize findings by themes, topics, or research questions
- Create hierarchical structures for complex topics
- Maintain clear connections between related concepts
- Organize chronologically when relevant (e.g., historical developments)

### 5. Analysis and Synthesis
- Compare and contrast different viewpoints
- Identify patterns, trends, and relationships
- Note gaps in available information
- Synthesize findings into coherent conclusions
- Highlight areas requiring further investigation

## Research Quality Standards

- Always verify claims with multiple sources
- Distinguish between facts, opinions, and interpretations
- Note the strength of evidence supporting each claim
- Identify and acknowledge limitations in available data
- Maintain objectivity while presenting findings
