# Document Creation Guidelines

## Purpose
This context provides guidelines and best practices for creating effective documents across various formats and purposes.

## Document Planning

### Before You Start
1. **Define your audience** - Who will read this document?
2. **Clarify the purpose** - What should readers know or do after reading?
3. **Choose the right format** - Technical spec, user guide, proposal, etc.
4. **Set the scope** - What's included and what's not?

### Document Structure
```
1. Title and Summary
2. Table of Contents (for longer docs)
3. Introduction/Overview
4. Main Content (organized logically)
5. Conclusion/Next Steps
6. Appendices (if needed)
```

## Writing Best Practices

### Clarity and Conciseness
- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (define when used)
- Keep sentences under 20 words when possible
- Use active voice: "We implemented" vs "It was implemented"

### Structure and Flow
- Use headings to organize content hierarchically
- Start sections with overview sentences
- Use bullet points for lists and key information
- Include transitions between major sections

### Technical Writing
- Define acronyms on first use: "Application Programming Interface (API)"
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include code examples with proper formatting
- Provide context for technical decisions

## Document Types

### User Guides
- Start with prerequisites and setup
- Use step-by-step instructions
- Include screenshots or diagrams
- Test all procedures before publishing

### Technical Specifications
- Begin with system overview
- Detail requirements and constraints
- Include architecture diagrams
- Specify APIs and data formats

### Proposals and Reports
- Executive summary first
- Support claims with data
- Include risk assessment
- Clear recommendations and next steps

### Meeting Notes and Documentation
- Capture decisions and action items
- Note attendees and date
- Summarize key discussion points
- Follow up on action items

## Formatting Guidelines

### Markdown Best Practices
```markdown
# Main Heading (H1)
## Section Heading (H2)
### Subsection (H3)

**Bold for emphasis**
*Italic for terms*
`Code snippets`

- Bullet points
1. Numbered lists

[Link text](URL)
![Image alt text](image-url)
```

### Visual Elements
- Use tables for structured data
- Include diagrams for complex concepts
- Add code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Use callout boxes for important information

## Review and Quality
